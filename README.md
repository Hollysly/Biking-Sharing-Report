# Biking-Sharing-Report

Predicting factors that influence peopleâ€™s usage on biking sharing services can help the growth of rental bike businesses. In this study, data directly from Capital Bikeshare was used to predict the number of registered and casual users during warm and cold seasons of the bikesharing system using predictors such as weather condition, temperature, and working days. With the use of four multivariate regression models based on data splits justified by a detailed data exploration, it is reasonable to reasonably predict the total bike count. It is found that registered and casuals follow different bike rental patterns and that there is a distribution difference between cold and warm weather seasons that should be accounted for. With these findings and subsequent four models, the improvement over a naive model that does not take into account these differences present in the data is shown.
